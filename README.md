## YT Playlist Randomizer

Playlist Randomizer lets You play randomized playlists and gives You access to details unavailable by default on YouTube, such as total duration of playlist. Playing and loading is way quicker and more stable than on the YouTube page, because lists are stored locally in browser storage. If minimalistic style, multiple themes and high responsiveness is what You enjoy, then this app is perfect for You!
